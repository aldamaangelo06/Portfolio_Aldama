      <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p class="text-spacing">
        ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m <strong>Angelo Aldama</strong>, a BS Information Systems student at the Technological Institute of the Philippines with a strong passion for both technology and creativity. We developed inventory management systems that address real-world issues during my academic career, such as PHP-based data analysis and barcode and RFID inventory management. I enjoy simplifying complicated concepts into practical uses.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-spacing">Aside from coding, I enjoy editing videos. I began making my own vlogs and effects in 2020 for fun, but it eventually became into something more serious. I developed my editing abilities at CIIT by pursuing certification in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects because of this desire.</p>
       
            
      <p class="text-spacing">Technology, in my opinion, is about more than simply logic and systems; it's also about effect, creativity, and learning from every encounter. This portfolio reflects my personality, which is inquisitive, driven, and constantly willing to learn.</p>
